  <p>Kenya Chronicles is a blog put together by Seth, Rose Ann's youngest son. Seth recently graduated in Computer Science at Sattler College and continues to live in the Boston area, fellowshipping with Followers of the Way and working as a Software Engineer. The winter of 2023 he was blessed with the opportunity to return to Kenya with his mom, and briefly, his brother Nathaniel. He was deeply impacted by the two months he spent with street children and teaching a bible seminar in 2018 and was thrilled to return for the fourth time in 2023.</p>

<p>Rose Ann has a long history in Kenya, beginning when her family moved there as missionaries in the 1970s. The goal of this site is to document that history. She dreamed of being a Kingdom laborer in Kenya since her teens, but it was only after marrying and raising a family of ten that this dream began to blossom. Now God is doing amazing things through her obedience to the vision he put in her heart.<br><br>
Rose has her own website, documentating the work of her non-profit Remeber the Poor, Inc. Head on over to get a bigger picture of her ministry: <a href="https://www.rememberthepoorinc.org/">https://www.rememberthepoorinc.org/</a></p>
