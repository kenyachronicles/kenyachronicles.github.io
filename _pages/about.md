Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am Seth, Rose Ann's youngest son. I recently graduated in Computer Science at Sattler College and continue to live in the Boston area, fellowshipping with Followers of the Way and working as a Software Engineer. This winter of 2023 I was blessed with the opportunity to return to Kenya with my mom, and briefly, my brother Nathaniel. This if my fourth time to Kenya. I was deeply impacted by the two months I spent with street children and teaching a bible seminar in 2018 and am thrilled to return.
